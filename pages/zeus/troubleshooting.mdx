This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common issues in Zeus.

## Common Issues

### Deployment Failures

#### Symptoms
- Deployment stays in "Pending" state
- Container fails to start
- Resource allocation fails

#### Solutions

1. Check resource availability:
```bash
zeus cluster-status
```

2. Verify configuration:
```bash
zeus config validate
```

3. Review deployment logs:
```bash
zeus logs --deployment my-deployment --tail 100
```

### Performance Issues

#### Symptoms
- High latency
- Low throughput
- Memory leaks
- GPU underutilization

#### Solutions

1. Check resource utilization:
```bash
zeus stats my-deployment
```

2. Profile the model:
```bash
zeus profile my-model
```

3. Optimize configuration:
```yaml
optimization:
  batch_size: 32
  cache_size: "2Gi"
  thread_count: 4
```

### API Issues

```

### Log Analysis
Analyze logs for patterns:
```bash
zeus logs-analyze --last-hour
```
