Learn how to monitor your Zeus deployments and ensure optimal performance.

## Metrics Overview

Zeus provides comprehensive metrics across several categories:

### System Metrics
- CPU usage
- Memory utilization
- GPU utilization
- Network I/O
- Disk usage

### Model Metrics
- Inference latency
- Throughput
- Error rates
- Model accuracy
- Prediction distributions

### API Metrics
- Request rates
- Response times
- Status codes
- Endpoint usage
- Client demographics

## Monitoring Dashboard

Access the monitoring dashboard:

```bash
zeus dashboard
```

### Custom Dashboards

Create custom views:

```yaml
# dashboard.yaml
panels:
  - name: "Model Performance"
    metrics:
      - latency
      - throughput
    visualization: "line-graph"
```

## Alerting

### Setting Up Alerts

Configure alerts in your project:

```yaml
alerts:
  - name: "High Latency"
    condition: "latency > 200ms"
    severity: "critical"
    notification:
      - type: "email"
        recipients: ["team@example.com"]
      - type: "slack"
        channel: "#alerts"
```

### Alert Types
- Threshold-based alerts
- Anomaly detection
- Error rate spikes
- Resource utilization
- Custom metrics

## Logging

### Viewing Logs

Access logs for your deployments:

```bash
zeus logs --deployment my-deployment
zeus logs --model my-model
zeus logs --api-endpoint /predict
```

### Log Integration

Zeus supports integration with popular logging platforms:
- ELK Stack
- Datadog
- Splunk
- CloudWatch

## Best Practices

1. Set up baseline metrics
