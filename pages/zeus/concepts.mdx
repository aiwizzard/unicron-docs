# Core Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you make the most of Zeus.

## Projects

A project in Zeus is a collection of models, configurations, and resources that work together. Each project has:

- A unique identifier
- Configuration files
- One or more model deployments
- Associated resources (compute, storage, etc.)

## Models

Models are the core building blocks in Zeus. A model consists of:

- Model artifacts (weights, parameters)
- Inference code
- Runtime environment
- API endpoints

## Deployments

A deployment represents a running instance of your model. Key aspects include:

- Scaling configuration
- Resource allocation
- Version management
- Traffic routing

## APIs

Zeus automatically creates RESTful APIs for your models:

- HTTP endpoints
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
- Request/response validation

## Monitoring

Zeus provides comprehensive monitoring:

- Resource utilization
- Model performance
- Request metrics
- Cost tracking

## Environments

Zeus supports multiple environments:

- Development
- Staging
- Production

Each environment can have its own:
- Configuration
- Resources
- Access controls
- Monitoring settings
