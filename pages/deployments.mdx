# Advanced Deployments

Advanced deployment features let you control how your API is deployed and scaled. Key capabilities include:

- Rolling updates with zero downtime
- A/B testing and canary deployments 
- Automatic recovery from failures
- Spot instance support for cost optimization
- Custom scaling policies and thresholds
- Multi-region deployments

## Deployment Categories

There are several main categories of deployments you can use depending on your workload:

1. **Realtime APIs**
   - For APIs and services that need immediate responses
   - Optimized for low latency and high availability
   - Ideal for web applications and user-facing services

  
2. **Task APIs** 
   - For short-lived, scheduled operations
   - Run to completion and then terminate
   - Good for periodic jobs and maintenance tasks
  

3. **Batch APIs**
   - For processing large volumes of data
   - Can be scheduled or triggered by events
   - Optimized for throughput over latency

  
4. **Async APIs**
   - For long-running operations
   - Non-blocking execution model
   - Suitable for resource-intensive tasks and background processing
